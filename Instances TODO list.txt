If a player was in an instance with ID X when the server force-quits...
...and then the server loads back up, and opens a *different* instance using ID X...
...and then the player logs back in...
...need to prevent them from showing up there



* Instances are not fully synced to clients; only dimensiontypes are synced



Are players not properly being added to an instance world's player entity list upon teleport?
