Somewhere along the line I broke instance creation; it's always creating an overworld instance instead of the selected type...
...something in "instances finally unload themselves automatically" caused the issue

Player-owned instances
Build permissions for owner and nobody else

Interact permissions for owner and nobody else
Command-based whitelist per owned instance for who is allowed to visit
Command to go to an instance of a specified owner (can probably just use existing /tpd with specially named instances using player UUIDs)


Non-Faerun

Make sure player spawns at 0, 0, 0 in void and skyroom world types
