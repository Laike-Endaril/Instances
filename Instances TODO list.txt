* Possible rooms with weighted chances
* Possible exit rooms with weighted chances (only 1 appears normally)

Themes have...
* Block category definitions (each category has a name and 1 or more blocks; dungeon generation references theme block categories to see which rooms can be used and what blocks to use for them)
* Enemy category definitions (work similar to block category definitions)

Modifiers have...
* Unique behaviors that need to be hard-coded

Rooms have...
* Type tags (puzzle, maze, parkour, melee, ranged combat, boss, traps, shop, animals)
* There is no "safe" tag; a room is "safe" if it does not have any dangerous tags (traps, boss, melee, etc.)
* Eg. a room with parkour where you can take fall damage should have the parkour and traps tags
* The general layout of the room, which is used as a base and has blocks replaced according to theme when generated
* Connection points, where they are to attach themselves to other rooms
* Enemy placements with spawn chances and enemy categories
* Chest placements with loot pools

Connection points have...
* A block position
* A direction
* A possible connecting room list
* A toggle for whether the connecting room list is whitelist / blacklist
